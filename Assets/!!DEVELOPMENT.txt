- seals balanced on spring joints in very center---position of mouse cursor determines how far tile tilts and how much of it is revealed to dread fire
- getting a pull has to do with revealing enough LIGHT for the seal to fill; the heat is a secondary consequence
  - determine "light flux" by looking at solar sail calculations, and imaginging camera is a beam of "cold" that the tiles are being turned away from
  - heat comes from the dread fire AND from touching the seal (a separate heat source, independent of the dread fire)
  - tiles must be tilted enough to receive sufficient light to charge fully in no longer than five seconds---if they aren't tilted that much, they get no light at all (but they still get heat)
- heat conducts by mathematical principles, based on differences between neighbouring cells; ONLY transfers when someone is touching a tile
  - heat flow in Joules/sec = -(thermal conductivity)*(Thot-Tcold), THEN convert joules to Kelvin with Change in Temp = joules/(mass * specific heat capacity)
  - because some constants were left out, just adjust "thermal conductivity" and "specific heat capacity" to get desired rate of transfer
- shake is primarily generated by heat
  - a tile at baseline shake (i.e. the shake due to heat alone) will never reveal enough of the dread fire to heat it up more; it will need to be kicked
  - consider using physics engine---balance tiles on Configurable Joint, and use Slerp Drive.
- a "kick" is a ripple of shake that spreads out from a disturbed tile.  this can happen when:
  - the tile is being touched; a continuous cycle of gentle kicks depending on shake of touched tile AND how strongly it's being influenced (i.e. how far from center mouse cursor is)
  - the tile is sloppily abandoned:  you want to move mouse to the center before abandoning, because this minimizes the kickback from letting go
    - a GOOD abandonment will send a pacifying wave out, reducing the additional kick shake of surrounding tiles
  - the tile is pulled:  this is the most dangerous; a strong kick ripples out, lasting no more than a second; kick strength is increased by how strongly tile is influenced AND how much the mouse was repositioned during the pull
- a "kicked" tile receives additional shake momentum
  - this momentum will remain until it is discharged
  - if a tile with additional kick shake is kicked again, there's an increasing chance of it discharging; otherwise, it adds the new shake momentum on
  - when a tile discharges, it receives a single "punch" of heat from the dread fire, then returns to its (new) baseline shake level
- there are kick & shake thresholds as well, but they aren't solid lines like with heat---instead, they're logarhythmic: a weak kick will still increase shake in a strongly-shaking tile, but not by much
- FEEDBACK *DURING* A PULL IS IMPORTANT: tiles on verge of cracking should make obvious signals here, so that a good abandonment/pacifying wave should prevent most disasters; also board NEVER updates unless a player is touching a tile
- key dichotomy:
  - BEGINNING OF GAME:  tilting tiles QUICKLY (by pushing on corners) is best, because this reduces heat (by reducing how long you're touching it) and shake doesn't matter so much
  - END OF GAME: tilting tiles SLOWLY is best, to keep an eye on the board and to minimize shake

===== INITIAL NOTES =====

Jenga-like game:

Obsidian tiles on square board float over the blast furnace of Hell.
At first, all is pitch black because the tiles cover the fire.
Mouse cursor is a spark that dimly illuminates the dark tiles as you move over them.
Player touches & holds to push one of the tiles towards the fire.
    Illumination from the blast furnace escapes around the edges, lighting the board for a bit.
This heats the tile for as long as the player holds it there.
After a few seconds, the tile pops back into place and the player has successfully completed a "pull".
If any tile, anywhere, gets too hot, it will explode---and the player 
immediately dies, as if the Jenga tower had fallen.

But there's more.

HEAT TRANSFER:  As a tile is warming UP (i.e. it's hotter than it was last tick), it sends
heat pulses to nearby tiles.  Only tiles that are cooler will be warmed by this method---and
they, in turn, will send out heat pulses of their own.

SHAKE: The warmer a tile is, the more "Shake" it has: a measurement of how violently
the tile is shaking from the heat it contains.  A shaking tile will ocasionally slip to 
the side and reveal enough of the Hell furnace to release a burst of heat upon it or
neighboring tiles---but never enough to cause a tile failure.

POP-BACK OSCILLATION:  The only risk of disaster comes when a player completes a pull.  As
the tile pops back into place, it causes a ripple of Shake to radiate outwards, disturbing 
the board from its equilibrium.  Tiles with higher Shake will oscillate the most, risking
even more heat from the Hell furnace behind.  This is when an unstable board will collapse.

TILE BREAK CHANCES:  Whenever a tile warms up, it performs a break check.  The chance of failure
is an exponential curve---impossible at first, then rapidly increasing in danger as higher levels
of heat are attained.


TO TEST:

Grid of simple tile meshes, each is a TILE object
    TILE PROPERTIES:
        - Contained Heat -- the amount of heat actually in the tile             ***CIRCLE GETS BIGGER INSIDE INDICATOR**
        - Shake Amplifier -- the distance away from "neutral" Shake (as determined by Contained Heat)
        - Maximum Heat -- will explode if Contained Heat exceeds this           ***CIRCLE INDICATOR***
    TILE METHODS:
        - Absorb Heat -- scan neighbours and increase Contained Heat accordingly
        - Update Shake -- determine Shake amount from Contained Heat AND Shake Amplifier.  If there's a Shake Amplifier, degrade it
            - Shake oscillates violently on a curve; each time the curve exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers a Furnace Blast
            - Shake Amplifier comes from Push/Receive Shake, and degrades fairly quickly over time.
        - Furnace Blast -- absorb heat directly from the Hell Furnace
        - Push Shake + ShakeID -- push Shake Amplifier bump to neighbouring tiles, along with ID so each Shake event only affects each tile once
        - Receive Shake + ShakeID -- after a pause, adjust Shake Amplifier accordingly, register ShakeID so will only be influenced once by this shake, and pass bump along via Push Shake.
        - Player Hold - steadily gain heat from Hell Furnace, until a specific amount has been gained.  Then, pop back into place and send a Push Shake event to neighboring tiles.
            - if Player lets go early, don't create a pop event
